            <b>Planar Terrain Spawner</b>
          </h1>

            <b>Project Description:</b>
            <br />
            This project was undertaken during my internship with the Institute
            for Infocomm Research. Its aim is to develop a real-time planar
            terrain spawner inside the PyBullet real-time simulation software.
            This feature would be useful for conducting research into the
            interaction of robot digital doubles with the digitally spawned
            terrains.
            <br /><br />
            For this project, I conducted in-depth studies into various plane
            segmentation algorithms, such as RANSAC, Hough Transform, etc. I
            also implemented and experimented with various state-of-the-art
            algorithms such as PEAC, MPS, etc., to evaluate the performance and
            accuracy of each plane segmentation algorithm.
            <br /><br />
            With PEAC as my plane segmentation algorithm basis, I obtained the
            plane equation from real-life sensor data. Then, I filtered out the
            points that lie outside of the plane and performed a convex hull
            calculation to obtain the edge polygon points. By projecting these
            points onto the ground surface, I performed mesh generation,
            successfully reconstructing the planar terrain inside the simulator.
            <br /><br />
